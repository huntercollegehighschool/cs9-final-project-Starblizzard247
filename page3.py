print("Original Lyrics: The blue moonlight cuts across our sight as pure and clear as a ringing bells, reaching for us in the night. As the wind calms my thoughts I have strung on this terrace, I feel the peace carried away by the wind\'s song. Open the door, and walk away. Never give in to the call of yesterday. Memories then made, those days sublime; these ruined halls entomb stolen time.")
