#reach for my noun1. I'll verb1 away. Into the noun2, oh, I wish I could verb2.

print("Original Lyrics: Reach for my hand. I\'ll soar away. Into the dawn, oh, I wish I could stay. Here in cherished halls, in peaceful days, I fear the edge of dawn, knowing time betrays. Faint lights pass through colored glass in this beloved place. Silver shines. The world dines, a smile on each face. As choice surrounds, comfort abounds, and I can feel I\'m breaking free. For just this moment lost in time, I am finally me.")
